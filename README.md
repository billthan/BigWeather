# BigWeather (Java, Windows)
A interactive Windows application that will implement location based weather updates. Includes statistical analysis tools for weather over a range of dates. This project is ongoing planning and features are continually added/removed. The project blog is located on my personal [website](https://billthan.dev/bigweather.html)

# Update 1.1 ([US1.31](https://github.com/billthan/BigWeather/tree/US1.31), [US1.33](https://github.com/billthan/BigWeather/tree/US1.33)) (InProgress, see git branches)
* Soon to add functionality for retroactive weather calls from the ClimaCell API. 

* Encryption of API keys; these keys will not be available for access to the public. 

# Major Update 1.0 ([US1.32](https://github.com/billthan/BigWeather/tree/US1.32)) (Latest Public Release)
* Implemented the functionality of ClimaCell API into the HTMLRequest calls. This was implemented in anticipation that the DarkSky API is soon to be shut down in late 2021.
